1.Because the time is ripe, the age is ready,
2.Because the world her womanâ€™s help demands,
3.Out of the long subjection and seclusion
4.Come to our field of warfare and confusion
5.The mother's heart and hands.

6.Long has she stood aside, endured and waited,
7.While man swung forward, toiling on alone;
8.Now, for the weary man, so long ill-mated,
9.Now, for the world for which she was created,
10.Comes woman to her own.

11.Not for herself! though sweet the air of freedom;
12.Not for herself, though dear the new-born power;
13.But for the child, who needs a nobler mother,
14.For the whole people, needing one another,
15.Comes woman to her hour.
